Low Power E-ink Display With Temperature Sensor

The initial project design was aimed at a wearable human body temperature sensor that would display the user's temperature onto an electronic ink display. Battery life has always been an obstacle when it comes to wearable technology, so this project aims at lowering the overall power consumption of each individual component. This post will focus on the initial project setup and proof of concept for the project design.
