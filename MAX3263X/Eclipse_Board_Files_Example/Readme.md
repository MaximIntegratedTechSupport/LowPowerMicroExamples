# MAX32630FTHR Eclipse™ Board Files Example

**Description:**
To add a custom designed board to the Eclipse™ environment, the user needs to develop custom board support files. This includes source files (.c) and header files (.h) required to prepare the execution environment prior to entering main() function, along with a list of supported adapters, a list of example projects known to work on the new board, and the default makefile. Maxim recommends that customers use existing board files as a reference to develop their own board support package.  

**Operation:**
This code was developed to show how to generate custom board support files and follows the instructions found in [Application Note 7222](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/userguides-and-manuals/7/7222.html). The end result is working board support files for the [MAX32630FTHR board](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/microcontrollers/MAX32630FTHR.html). For operation, please see the application note.
